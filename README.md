# Cartoon-characters-generation-VAE


Hi, there!

In this work, I tried to generate cartoon face-caraters via convolutional variational autoencoder (VAE).
I've got not so perfect results, but generated faces are recognizable. I had some problems with Google Colab RAM-limitations, and I guess, it is more appropriate to use GANs for issues like that. However!

Best wishes,
